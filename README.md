# WordPress Google CSE

This is not another iframe embed or AJAX result listing plugin. Instead search results from your Google Custom Search Engine is served via WordPress search listing. No need to customize your theme or search box.

PS: You'll need an [Google API key](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and a [Google Custom Search Engine ID](http://www.google.com/cse/) to use it. DS.

## Installation

1. Place the plugin (`google-cse/` directory) in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter and save your Google API key and Google Custom Search Engine ID
4. You're done, celebrate with a cup of coffee?
